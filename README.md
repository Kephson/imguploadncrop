# Image upload and cropping script

A little image upload and cropping script based on [wideimage](http://wideimage.sourceforge.net/) and [imageAreaSelect](http://odyniec.net/projects/imgareaselect/)

imguploadncrop is based on an earlier version from Keith Levi Lumanog's blog.

This project is based on mgAreaSelect from odyniec.net:
